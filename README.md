# üß† TVB Reservoir

**TVB Reservoir** is a GPU-accelerated reservoir computing framework integrated with **The Virtual Brain (TVB)** platform. 
It enables large-scale reservoir computing with brain network simulations principles as their nodes, 
with CUDA-accelerated kernels for performance-critical tasks such as metric computation.

## üõ† Installation

1. Ensure your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are properly installed.  
2. Clone this repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tvb-reservoir.git
   cd tvb-reservoir
   ```  
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```  
4. Install dependencies:  

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üß© Running the Model Drivers

The model drivers are located in the `root/` directory. To run a basic reservoir simulation:

```bash
python model_driver_montbrio.py 
python model_driver_larterbreakspear.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Metrics Kernels

Custom CUDA kernels for computing complexity metrics are located in `metrics/`. The following metrics are supported:

- **PCI**: Estimates system perturbation complexity  
- **DFA**: Assesses long-term temporal correlations  
- **Lyapunov Exponent**: Evaluates sensitivity to initial conditions  

These kernels are automatically invoked during the simulation pipeline when metrics computation is enabled.

To compile kernels manually (if necessary):

## üìä Plotting Metrics Output

After running a simulation, results are stored in the `data/` directory. To generate the plots for in the ICANN25 paper:

```bash
python plottools/plot_print_all.py 
```

This will produce figures for:  
‚úî PCI distribution for each unique TVB simulation
‚úî DFA distribution for each unique TVB simulation
‚úî Lyapunov distribution for each unique TVB simulation

## üìù Notes

- Requires TVB structural connectivity data  
- CUDA kernels are optimized for single-precision performance  
- Large simulations may require considerable GPU memory
